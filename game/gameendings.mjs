  but can't quite put their finger on just how in the world the latest issue about to hit the 
  presses is marginally better.`,
  mediumScore: `Some of the humans come to you the following day. One of them asks you if you've 
  been tinkering with any of the machines. Emotionless, you confess your deeds. Three of them 
  recoil in horror, but one of the senior editors takes a second look at you; her eyes twinkle 
  with something, but your sensors can't detect 
  with what. Your logic circuits tell you her eyes need repairing, but you don't have an active 
  work order for that right now.`,
  highScore: `The next day, when you step out of your repair station, the humans have convened. 
  They approach you, or at least try, as you remembered to put the security barrier up before 
  charging. They kneel and plead with you to come and work for them full time. They ask you how 
  you fixed the situation and brought them out of dire straits.`,
